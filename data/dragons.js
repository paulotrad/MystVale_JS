Raised among books and gears, he’s always darting through the stacks—fixing what’s broken, nudging what’s stuck, and leaving a trail of glitter and laughter behind. With his trusty Whistle Puff, he cools down machines, flips pages, and clears the dust others miss. He may be small, but Little Trouble keeps Mystvale running.",
