    description: "Lil’ Trouble lives on the edge of Library Ridge, where the air smells like paper and the floorboards squeak just enough to warn you he’s coming. Born and raised among scrolls and gears, he’s been zipping through the dragon realms since he hatched—leaving trails of glitter, misplaced tools, and belly laughs wherever he goes. Older dragons say they always find him where he shouldn’t be: balancing on ladders, hiding in barrels, or sneaking behind scroll shelves just to rearrange them into smiley faces.\n\nAt first, townsfolk thought he was just poking around, but after he quietly unjammed the old water mill with nothing but a puff and a screwdriver, they stopped asking questions.\n\nWhat makes Trouble different isn’t his claws or size — it’s his Whistle Puff: a sharp burst of air from his snout that he uses to:\n- Cool down overheated machine gears\n- Clear dust from jammed switches\n- Turn book pages when his claws are full\n- And sometimes… accidentally blow the lid off a box of marshmallows\n\nHe’s not the strongest or the loudest, but when something breaks in Mystvale, he’s usually already on his way to fix it. You’ll find him under benches, behind pipes, or up high where the pulley ropes knot — always listening, always watching.\n\nHe doesn’t chase praise. He just likes things to work. He may be small, but Little Trouble makes a big difference.",
