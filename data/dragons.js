   "description": "Lil’ Trouble lives on the edge of Library Ridge, where the floorboards squeak and the shelves lean just enough to know he’s nearby. Raised among books and gears, he’s always darting through the stacks—fixing what’s broken, nudging what’s stuck, and leaving a trail of glitter and laughter behind. With his trusty Whistle Puff, he cools down machines, flips pages, and clears the dust others miss. He may be small, but Little Trouble keeps Mystvale running.",

    description:
      "Bruntide wasn’t born with fire in his chest or fame in his name. Raised beneath the Scorchspire by a family of flour-dusted bakers, he surprised everyone when he entered the Ember Trial — a perilous rite of passage where young dragons face the Five Fires of Courage. He braved the whispering Flames of Fear, crossed the vanishing Bridge of Smoke, and faced himself in the Ash Mirror — a battle not of muscle, but of will. His snout bears a scar from that fight, a mark not of failure, but of quiet strength. Now Bruntide travels Mystvale with a flame-marked shield and a heart forged in trials. He protects the small and the scared — not with roars, but with steady courage. When danger rises, children whisper his name and search the skies for the shadow of a dragon who walks into fear, not away from it. Because Bruntide knows: true bravery isn’t loud. It just shows up.",
